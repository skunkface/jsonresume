    "summary": "I am a very quick learner with the ability to easily adapt to my surroundings. I have experience in Graphic Design for both web and print as well as Web Development work, focusing on HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and JQuery. Recently I have been learning AngularJS and Laravel to go along with project asset management using npm and Bower as well as Git. To go along with this I also have extensive knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I have an intense desire to learn, always striving to expand and develop my abilities. I graduated from the College of Idaho with a History degree; while this might seem like an unrelated field, I feel it has given me a unique view of how the small parts work together to form the final polished product. Understanding the connections between the small unseen pieces is something that I try to incorporate into every part of my life. The future is an unending wealth of knowledge, I look forward to discovering its treasures.",
